Manipulate start point and width for the slice by changing the "range selction"  in property editor as shown in figure below and visualize its effect from 3D view.

### Polygon Filter

Once "Polygon Filter" is selected, it will allow user to start picking target points on 3D view, such that one can probe the reservoir for coordinates for the "Polygone". Once
