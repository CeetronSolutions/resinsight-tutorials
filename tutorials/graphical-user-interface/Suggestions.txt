Suggestions:
"View" - Is not an intuitive name and might be confused with **View** in the property tree. An alternative could be to rename it something along the lines "Orientation and Transformations" which provides a more descriptive naming scheme.

"Repeat from start": This action works as advertised. If played backwards it will start from the end. Could be renamed.

"Animation Speed": Should be evident
