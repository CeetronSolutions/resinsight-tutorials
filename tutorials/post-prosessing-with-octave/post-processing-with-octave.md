Execute the script by right-clicking the script and clicking "Execute". You can also observe in the [Process Monitor](../graphical-user-interface/graphical-user-interface.md#process-monitor) that the script has been completed.

## Step 5. Visualizing the results from the post-processing step.

To visualize the results generated by the script, select [**Cell Results**](../graphical-user-interface/graphical-user-interface.md#cell-results) in the [Project Tree](../graphical-user-interface/graphical-user-interface.md#project-tree). Then navigate to the [Property Editor](../graphical-user-interface/graphical-user-interface.md#project-tree) and select a different "Type" called "Generated".  

## Step 6. Export to GRDECL text-file
